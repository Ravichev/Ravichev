## 👋 About Me

My name is Maksim, and I’m currently learning Data Science. I hold a college and bachelor’s degree in programming. Right now, I’m actively growing in the field — solving problems, studying models and technologies from scratch.  
This README reflects my learning journey and progress. Enjoy reading! 🙂

| Project | Description | Technologies |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| [Custom Data Preprocessor](https://github.com/Ravichev/Custom-Data-Preprocessor) | A task where I began learning `python` in practice and refreshed my OOP knowledge. | `python`|
| [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Ravichev/Linear-Regression-from-scratch) | Studying how linear regression works under the hood, with a comparison between my own class and the scikit-learn implementation. | `python`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn` |
| [Police Stops EDA](https://github.com/Ravichev/Police-stops-EDA) | Exploring the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). |  `python`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` |
| [Titanic](https://github.com/Ravichev/Titanic) | A classic supervised classification problem — predicting survivors of the Titanic. | `python`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn` |
| [Spaceship Titanic](https://github.com/Ravichev/Spaceship-Titanic) | Another classification task — predicting missing passengers on the Space Titanic. | `python`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `catboost` |
| [House Prices Regression](https://github.com/Ravichev/House-prices-regression) | A classic supervised regression problem — predicting house prices. | `python`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn` |
| [Anime Recommendation Filtering](https://github.com/Ravichev/Anime-Recommendation-Filtering) | Studying how filtering-based recommendation systems work. | `python`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `surprise` |
| [Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/Ravichev/Unsupervised-Anomaly-Detection) | Detecting anomalies in data using `DBSCAN` and `IsolationForest`. | `python`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn` |
